---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **spatial** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

# Effective Visualization Checklist

- **Effective?** right for data, clear purpose, unbiased, not misleading
- **Complete?** title, subtitle, axis & legend labels, caption, data annotation
- **Accessible?** color-blind safe palette, alt text, readable text size

# 5. Spatial Visualization

**Research Question:** Which U.S. states had the highest murder arrest rates in 1973?

```{r, fig.cap="U.S. Murder Arrest Rates by State (1973)", fig.alt="Choropleth map of the United States filled by murder arrest rate.", warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(viridis)

states_map <- map_data("state")
arrests <- USArrests %>%
  rownames_to_column("region") %>%
  mutate(region = tolower(region))

map_df <- left_join(states_map, arrests, by = "region")

ggplot(map_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Murder)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Murder Rate") +
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  labs(
    title    = "Murder Arrest Rates by State (1973)",
    subtitle = "USArrests dataset",
    caption  = "Source: datasets::USArrests"
  ) +
  theme_void(base_size = 14)
```

*Summary:* The highest arrest rates are clustered in the Deep South (e.g., Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama), reflecting regional social dynamics of the era. Northern and Western states mostly register lower rates (3â€“5 per 100k), revealing clear geographic patterns in violent crime across the country.
