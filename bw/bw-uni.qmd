Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

# Effective Visualization Checklist

- **Effective?** right for data, clear purpose, unbiased, not misleading
- **Complete?** title, subtitle, axis & legend labels, caption, data annotation
- **Accessible?** color-blind safe palette, alt text, readable text size

# 1. Univariate Visualization

**Research Question:** What is the distribution of life expectancy across countries in 2007?

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of Life Expectancy among Countries in 2007", fig.alt="Histogram showing life expectancy distribution with a peak around 70-75 years.", warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(viridis)

life2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)

ggplot(life2007, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = viridis(1), color = "white") +
  labs(
    title    = "Life Expectancy Distribution (2007)",
    subtitle = "Gapminder data: Each bar = Number of countries",
    x        = "Life Expectancy (years)",
    y        = "Number of Countries",
    caption  = "Source: gapminder package"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

*Summary:* In 2007, life expectancy across countries shows a roughly bell-shaped distribution centered around 70–75 years. A small left tail contains nations with lower health outcomes (around 45–60 years), while a right tail extends toward very high values (above 80 years), reflecting developed nations with excellent healthcare. The median is slightly higher than the mean, indicating a mild left skew driven by a handful of low‑life‑expectancy countries.
