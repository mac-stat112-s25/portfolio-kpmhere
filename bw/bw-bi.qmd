title: "Bivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

# Effective Visualization Checklist

- **Effective?** right for data, clear purpose, unbiased, not misleading
- **Complete?** title, subtitle, axis & legend labels, caption, data annotation
- **Accessible?** color-blind safe palette, alt text, readable text size

# 2. Bivariate Visualization

**Research Question:** How does engine displacement relate to highway fuel efficiency in cars?

```{r, fig.cap="Engine Displacement vs Highway MPG with Trend Line", fig.alt="Scatterplot of engine displacement vs highway mpg showing a downward trend.", warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "#1b9e77") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(
    title    = "Engine Displacement vs Highway MPG",
    subtitle = "mpg dataset from ggplot2",
    x        = "Engine Displacement (liters)",
    y        = "Highway MPG",
    caption  = "Source: ggplot2::mpg"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

*Summary:* There is a strong negative linear relationship: each additional liter of engine displacement corresponds to approximately a 5‑8 MPG drop on the highway. Small‑engine cars (1–2 L) cluster around 25–40 MPG, while large V6/V8 engines (3–6 L) mostly fall below 25 MPG. A few outliers—performance or hybrid vehicles—show higher efficiency or atypical displacement.
