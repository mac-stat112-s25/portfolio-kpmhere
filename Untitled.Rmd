## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# Load US states map data
us_states <- map_data("state")  # Get state boundaries

# Create a dataset with state earnings (Replace with real data)
set.seed(42)
cargurus_earnings <- data.frame(
  state = tolower(state.name),  # Convert state names to lowercase for merging
  abb = state.abb,  # State abbreviations
  earnings = runif(50, 500000, 5000000)  # Generate random earnings ($500K - $5M)
)

# Merge earnings data with map data
us_map <- us_states %>%
  left_join(cargurus_earnings, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Compute state centers for label placement
state_centers <- data.frame(state.center, abb = state.abb)

# Plot the map
ggplot(us_map) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = earnings), color = "white") +
  geom_text(data = state_centers, aes(x = x, y = y, label = abb), size = 3, color = "black") +  # Add state initials
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightgreen", high = "darkgreen", name = "Earnings ($M)", 
                      breaks = seq(500000, 5000000, by = 1000000),  # Set clearer breaks
                      labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +  # Convert to millions
  theme_void() +  # Remove axes and background
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.key.width = unit(1.5, "cm"),  # Make legend keys wider
    legend.key.height = unit(0.6, "cm"), # Increase legend key spacing
    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)  # Increase legend text size
  ) +
  ggtitle("CarGurus Earnings by State")
